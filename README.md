# rideShareCalculator
##Thinkfful (http://thinkful.com) Portofolio Execerice - Angularjs and gulp implementation.

## background
I built this app in response of frustation ride share driver experience when working. there are no way the driver can see instantly how much they made after each ride. they always get a statement the following day. why not instantly?
## This app can be very useful for the driver who want to control their finances and keep track of every single income they earn driving.

##Functionality
Driver will input the number in the web app and the app will compute the number for them by showing them exactly how much the earn after commission and other fees.

##Technical
The app is built entirely using Angularjs, gulp and some javascript. The site is also responsive to mobile and desktop
